FEATURE 1:

Algorithm 1 High-level Server Logic for broadcast feature
1: Create a TCP server socket and bind it to an IP address and port
2: Start listening for incoming client connections
3: Initialize an empty list to store connected clients
4: while server is running do
    5: Accept a new client connection
    6: Add the client to the list of active clients
    7: Start a new thread to handle communication with that client
8: end while

9: Client Handler (in each thread):
10: Continuously receive messages from the assigned client
11: For each received message, forward it to all other connected clients
12: If the client disconnects, close the connection and remove it from the list


Algorithm 2 High-level Client Logic for broadcast application
1: Create a TCP client socket
2: Connect to the server using the server’s IP address and port
3: Display the client’s local address and port information
4: Start a background thread to continuously:
    • Receive incoming messages from the server
    • Display received messages to the user
5: In the main thread, repeatedly:
    • Accept user input from the keyboard
    • Send the typed message to the server
6: If the server disconnects or an error occurs, close the connection


FEATURE 2:

Algorithm 3 High-level Server Logic for One-to-One Chat (Feature 2)
1: Create a TCP server socket and bind it to an IP address and port
2: Start listening for incoming client connections
3: Initialize an empty dictionary to store each client’s username and socket
4: while server is running do
    5: Accept a new client connection
    6: Request and receive the client’s username
    7: Add the username–socket pair to the dictionary
    8: Start a new thread to handle communication with that client
9: end while

10: Client Handler (in each thread):
11: while the client is connected do
    12: Wait to receive a message from the client
    13: if message starts with @target then
        14: Extract the target username and message text
        15: if target username exists in the client dictionary then
            16: Send the message only to that specific target client
        17: else
            18: Inform the sender that the target user was not found
        19: end if
    20: else
        21: Inform the sender to use the correct format (@username message)
    22: end if
23: end while
24: When the client disconnects, remove it from the dictionary

Algorithm 4 High-level Client Logic for One-to-One Chat (Feature 2)
1: Create a TCP client socket
2: Connect to the server using the provided IP address and port
3: Wait for the server to request a username
4: Input the username from the user and send it to the server
5: Start a background thread to continuously:
    • Receive incoming messages from the server
    • Display the received messages to the user
6: In the main thread, repeatedly:
    • Accept user input from the keyboard
    • To send a private message, type in the format @username message
    • Send the message to the server for delivery to the target user
7: If the server disconnects or an error occurs, close the socket connection
