# 3461-Project

For this project, Feature 1 files are "Server.py" and "Client.py"
Feature 2 files are "Server_F2.py" and "Client_F2.py"
Feature 3 files are "Server_F3.py" and "Client_F3.py". 

For feature 3, we implemented the ability to create and send messages within a group chat. A client can create a group chat using ‘#’ followed by the group name and the usernames of all intended members (e.g., #BestGroupEver @Kayla @Leya). To message the group, the client uses ‘$’ followed by the group name and their text (e.g., $#BestGroupEver hi there). We added this feature because group messaging is common in real-world communication and prevents users from needing to send the same message individually to multiple recipients.
